### `Stack`
Application in which a stack type structure is considered represented using a series of integer values. In addition to this series, an integer variable (stack pointer) is also declared. This will permanently have the value of the index of the last element in the stack. To operate in the stack, the dedicated push () and pop () functions created in the application are used. The push () function adds a value to the stack at the end of the series, and pop () extracts an element from the stack, the last one. A value is added to the stack. Then the last element is extracted from the stack, after which another element is extracted from the stack, but it is not preserved.
